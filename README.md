### To move in the array, press 'J', 'I', 'K', 'L', which represent 'left', 'up', 'down', and 'right'.
### While playing a 16*16 Sudoku, numbers exceed 9 can be entered by replacing '10' with 'A', '11' with 'B', and so on.
### Right after user enter their answers, they can know if their answers are correct by checking the color of numbers on the screen.
### During the game, users can press 'H' to get the answer of the blank.

# Note
If you download this project, open it with Visual Studio but find it is unable to compile since the compiler tells you that it can't open <stdc++.h>, you should install the c++ header <stdc++.h> by yourself. Lots of solutions on the Internet can be found.  
As long as you have pre-installed <stdc++.h>, it's still possible that compiler won't work because I've edited my own <stdc++.h> and added some other headers I usually used.  
Including extra library below in "generate.h" might be helpful.  
```
#include <random>  
#include <windows.h>  
#include <Windows.h>  
```
